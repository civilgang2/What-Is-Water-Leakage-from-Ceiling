<h2>What to Do Before You Call a Plumber</h2>
<p>Here are some of the things to do before you call a plumber for a ceiling leak.</p>

<p>A ceiling leak can also be caused due to&nbsp;<strong>leaks in the water supply lines that attach to the toilet or to the sink trap</strong>. Leak may be occurring through the line joints. The Leak can also be due to drain pipes. Drain pipe leaks are those that appear and disappear across your ceiling.</p>
<h3><span style="font-size: 11px;">Clear the Area</span></h3>
<p>If your ceiling is leaking, it may be causing damage to any of the belongings you have under the leak. Clear the area to make sure the water isn't causing further damage to any of your items such as furniture, electronics, clothes, or other valuables.</p>

<p>Clearing the area also provides you or your plumber direct access to the portion of the ceiling that is leaking. This way, you can use a ladder or a step stool to assess the problem.</p>
<h3>Get a Bucket</h3>
<p>Once you clear the area, place a bucket under the affected area so it can catch the dripping water from your ceiling. This prevents further damage to your flooring and provides you with a better idea of how much water is coming out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may notice that water is streaming continuously or only at certain times &ndash; for instance, after you flush the toilet or run the shower.</p>
<h3>See If You Can Stop the Source of Water</h3>
<p>You may be able to use a shut off valve to stop water from flowing into the affected pipe or pipes that are causing your ceiling to leak. You may also notice that the water is only leaking when you use a specific toilet, shower, sink, or your washing machine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until you are able to fix the problem, you may discontinue water usage at the source of the problem to prevent further water damage to your ceiling, floors, or walls.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Why Your Ceiling May Be Leaking</h2>
<p>Here are some common causes of ceiling leaks.</p>
<h3>Toilet Leak</h3>
<p>Toilet leaks can come from the water or supply tank, but some of the most dangerous water leaks that may affect ceilings come from the worn wax ring.</p>
<p>Water seeps through the wax ring when you flush and may start running behind the walls, dripping down pipes, and causing water damage on your ceiling. This moistens the drywall, producing wet spots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Shower Leak</h3>
<p>Shower leaks may be difficult to detect at first since all of the plumbing is buried in a wall and surrounded by tiles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your ceiling leak may be caused by an upstairs shower if the tiles or flooring are peeling or curling near the shower. Worn out caulking or holes in water supply lines may be the culprits.</p>

<h3>Sink Leak</h3>
<p>You may not notice your sink is leaking until there is water pooling on the floor. By that point, the cabinet doors may be damaged and moldy at the bottom. The water leaking from your sink may be coming from:</p>
<ul>
<li>The supply hoses</li>
<li>Damaged caulk</li>
<li>Loose P-trap connectors</li>
<li>A loose strainer or a strainer that needs to be replaced</li>
</ul>
<h3>Roof Leak</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why your roof might be leaking. Some of the most common reasons include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holes</li>
<li>Missing or damaged shingles</li>
<li>Gutter problems</li>
<li>Ridge caps and valleys</li>
<li>Vents, skylights, and chimneys</li>
</ul>
<p>Roof leaks typically cause larger water spots to your ceiling that brown and grow mold quickly if left unchecked. Every time it rains, the spot may get bigger, and water may also run down your walls. You may have to go up onto your roof to assess the problem further so you can see what the leak is being caused by.</p>
